# ML MCP Integration Patterns & Code Examples
**Date**: 2025-01-09 10:20:00
**Purpose**: Practical integration patterns for ML-enhanced MCP servers

## Integration Pattern Templates

### Pattern 1: Context-Aware Memory Integration

```markdown
### ðŸ§  **ML-ENHANCED MEMORY OPERATIONS** (use "ultrathink")

**Legacy Memory Storage:**
- **memory**: Store [data] using traditional key-value storage

**ML-Enhanced Context-Aware Storage:**
- **context-memory**: Store [data] with automatic contextual understanding
  - Intelligent classification based on content analysis
  - Predictive retrieval suggestions based on current context
  - Relationship mapping to existing knowledge
  - Usage pattern learning for optimization

**Example Usage:**
```yaml
# Instead of:
memory.store("debugging_session_123", session_data)

# Use:
context_memory.store({
  content: session_data,
  auto_classify: true,
  predict_related: true,
  learn_patterns: true
})
# Returns: {
#   stored_id: "auto_generated_contextual_id",
#   classification: "debugging/error_pattern/authentication",
#   related_memories: ["session_456", "pattern_789"],
#   retrieval_hints: ["auth_errors", "session_debugging"]
# }
```
```

### Pattern 2: Knowledge Graph Enhancement

```markdown
### ðŸ”— **KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTEGRATION** (use "ultrathink")

**Traditional Search:**
- **filesystem**: Search for files matching pattern
- **grep**: Search for content patterns

**ML-Enhanced Graph Search:**
- **knowledge-graph**: Build and query semantic relationships
  ```yaml
  graph_query:
    start_node: "current_feature"
    relationship_types: ["depends_on", "similar_to", "conflicts_with"]
    depth: 3
    include_metadata: true
  ```

**Integration Example:**
```python
# Build knowledge graph during analysis
knowledge_graph.add_node({
  id: "feature_payment_processing",
  type: "feature",
  attributes: {
    complexity: "high",
    dependencies: ["auth_system", "database", "payment_gateway"],
    patterns: ["transaction", "security", "validation"]
  }
})

# Query related knowledge
related = knowledge_graph.query({
  start: "feature_payment_processing",
  find: "similar_features_with_solutions",
  include: ["implementation_patterns", "common_issues", "test_strategies"]
})
```
```

### Pattern 3: ML Code Intelligence Integration

```markdown
### ðŸ¤– **ML CODE INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENT** (use "ultrathink")

**Traditional Code Analysis:**
- **filesystem**: Read and analyze code files
- **grep**: Search for code patterns

**ML-Enhanced Code Intelligence:**
- **ml-code-intelligence**: Deep code understanding and pattern recognition
  ```yaml
  code_analysis:
    analyze: "src/components/PaymentForm.jsx"
    detect:
      - security_vulnerabilities
      - performance_bottlenecks
      - code_smells
      - optimization_opportunities
    suggest:
      - refactoring_patterns
      - best_practices
      - similar_implementations
  ```

**Real-World Example:**
```javascript
// ML Code Intelligence detects:
// 1. Potential XSS vulnerability in user input handling
// 2. Missing error boundary
// 3. Inefficient re-renders due to inline functions

// Suggests:
ml_code_intelligence.suggest_fix({
  issue: "xss_vulnerability",
  context: "payment_form_validation",
  confidence: 0.92
})
// Returns: {
//   fix: "Use DOMPurify.sanitize() for user inputs",
//   example: "const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);",
//   similar_fixes: ["auth_form_fix_2024", "profile_sanitization"]
// }
```
```

### Pattern 4: Command Analytics Integration

```markdown
### ðŸ“Š **COMMAND ANALYTICS TRACKING** (use "think hard")

**Analytics Integration for Every Command:**
```yaml
command_analytics.track({
  command: "implement_feature_10x",
  start_time: timestamp,
  context: {
    project_type: "react_app",
    feature_complexity: "high",
    team_size: 5
  },
  metrics_to_track: [
    "execution_time",
    "resource_usage",
    "output_quality",
    "user_satisfaction"
  ]
})

# After execution:
command_analytics.complete({
  command: "implement_feature_10x",
  end_time: timestamp,
  outcomes: {
    success: true,
    lines_of_code: 450,
    tests_written: 12,
    documentation_generated: true
  },
  learnings: {
    effective_patterns: ["test_first", "modular_design"],
    bottlenecks: ["api_design_phase"],
    optimization_opportunities: ["parallel_test_generation"]
  }
})
```

**Analytics Dashboard Query:**
```sql
-- Get command effectiveness insights
SELECT 
  command_name,
  AVG(execution_time) as avg_time,
  COUNT(*) as usage_count,
  AVG(success_rate) as effectiveness,
  JSON_EXTRACT(learnings, '$.effective_patterns') as best_patterns
FROM command_analytics
WHERE timestamp > datetime('now', '-30 days')
GROUP BY command_name
ORDER BY effectiveness DESC;
```
```

### Pattern 5: Workflow Optimizer Integration

```markdown
### ðŸ”„ **WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION INTELLIGENCE** (use "ultrathink")

**Traditional Sequential Workflow:**
1. Research â†’ 2. Plan â†’ 3. Implement â†’ 4. Test â†’ 5. Document

**ML-Optimized Adaptive Workflow:**
```yaml
workflow_optimizer.analyze({
  workflow_type: "feature_implementation",
  context: current_project_state,
  constraints: {
    deadline: "2 days",
    resources: ["senior_dev", "junior_dev"],
    priority: "high"
  }
})

# Returns optimized workflow:
{
  optimized_steps: [
    {
      phase: "parallel_research_and_scaffolding",
      tasks: [
        { task: "research_patterns", assigned: "ml_system", duration: "async" },
        { task: "generate_boilerplate", assigned: "junior_dev", duration: "30m" }
      ]
    },
    {
      phase: "accelerated_implementation",
      tasks: [
        { task: "core_logic", assigned: "senior_dev", duration: "2h" },
        { task: "test_generation", assigned: "ml_system", duration: "parallel" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  predicted_time_savings: "40%",
  risk_mitigation: ["pre_generated_tests", "continuous_validation"]
}
```

**Workflow Learning:**
```python
# After workflow completion
workflow_optimizer.learn({
  workflow_id: "feature_impl_12345",
  actual_duration: "4.5h",
  bottlenecks: ["api_design_discussion"],
  successful_optimizations: ["parallel_test_generation"],
  team_feedback: "positive"
})
```
```

## Integration Best Practices

### 1. Gradual Enhancement
```markdown
# Start with additions, not replacements
**Existing Functionality:**
- [Keep all current MCP calls]

**ML Enhancement Layer:**
- [Add ML MCP calls for intelligence]
- [Measure improvement metrics]
- [Gradually shift core functionality]
```

### 2. Fallback Strategies
```python
try:
  # Try ML-enhanced approach first
  result = ml_code_intelligence.analyze(code)
except MLServiceUnavailable:
  # Fallback to traditional analysis
  result = traditional_analysis(code)
  # Queue for ML analysis when available
  ml_queue.add_for_later(code)
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```yaml
performance_tracking:
  measure:
    - ml_enhancement_overhead
    - accuracy_improvements
    - time_savings
    - user_satisfaction
  thresholds:
    - max_latency: 500ms
    - min_accuracy_gain: 20%
    - required_time_savings: 30%
```

### 4. Continuous Learning
```python
# Every ML interaction improves the system
ml_feedback_loop = {
  "collect": "user_actions_and_outcomes",
  "analyze": "effectiveness_patterns",
  "improve": "model_parameters",
  "deploy": "enhanced_predictions"
}
```
