## ðŸš€ 10X DEEP ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE
*Enhanced with full MCP ecosystem orchestration*

**Claude, perform COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-SOURCE analysis and create INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN strategic plan.**

### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: MARKET & COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE** (use "think hard")

**1.1 External Intelligence Gathering**
- **websearch**: Research latest trends in project domain/technology stack
- **websearch**: "best practices [detected_tech_stack] 2024 enterprise"
- **websearch**: "performance benchmarks [primary_language] applications"
- **fetch**: Analyze 2-3 top competitor implementations or similar projects
- **github**: Search for highest-starred projects in similar domain
- **github**: Identify trending patterns and architectures

**1.2 Technology Intelligence**
- **websearch**: "[detected_frameworks] latest updates security patches"
- **websearch**: "migration guide [current_version] to [latest_version]"
- **fetch**: Download latest framework documentation for gap analysis
- **context7**: Access real-time framework documentation (add "use context7" for current API references)
- **github**: Research issues and solutions for similar tech stacks
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review previous analysis patterns and learnings with intelligent classification and cross-system access

**1.3 Internal Discovery**
- **filesystem**: Comprehensive codebase structure analysis
- **sqlite**: Query any existing metrics/performance data
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review previous analysis patterns and learnings with intelligent classification and cross-system access

### âš¡ **PHASE 2: MULTI-LAYERED ANALYSIS** (use "think harder")

**2.1 Competitive Benchmarking**
- **Cross-reference findings** from Phase 1 research
- **Performance comparison** vs industry standards (from websearch)
- **Feature gap analysis** vs competitors (from fetch analysis)
- **Architecture comparison** vs proven patterns (from github research)

**2.2 Enhanced Technical Analysis**
- **Code quality** vs industry benchmarks (researched standards)
- **Security posture** vs latest threat intelligence (websearch)
- **Performance metrics** vs competitive baseline (fetch data)
- **Testing coverage** vs industry best practices (github examples)

**2.3 Intelligence Synthesis**
- **smart_memory_unified**: Store analysis patterns with automatic classification and cross-system synchronization
- **chroma-rag**: Create semantic embeddings for pattern matching and similarity search
- **sqlite**: Store structured benchmark data with ML training labels for trend analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ **PHASE 3: STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE PLANNING** (use "ultrathink")

**3.1 Market-Informed Prioritization**
- **Immediate wins** (next 3 days) - based on competitive research
- **Strategic improvements** (next 2 weeks) - aligned with industry trends
- **Innovation opportunities** (next month) - gaps found in competitor analysis
- **Competitive advantages** - unique strengths vs market research

**3.2 Resource-Rich Implementation Plan**
- **Link each recommendation** to researched examples/documentation
- **Include cost-benefit analysis** based on industry benchmarks
- **Provide implementation templates** from github research
- **Reference best practices** from competitive analysis

### ðŸ“Š **ENHANCED OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**

**Structured Intelligence Reports with ML Training Data:**
```yaml
# Market Analysis Report
filename: Knowledge/documentation/market_analysis_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md
frontmatter:
  type: market_analysis
  timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
  classification: competitive_intelligence
  ml_labels: [market_trends, competitive_positioning, opportunity_scoring]
  success_metrics: [market_share_potential, competitive_advantage_score]
  cross_references: [competitive_analysis, technical_benchmarks]
```

**Multi-System Storage with Redundancy:**
- **Primary**: `smart_memory_unified` - Unified orchestration with automatic classification
- **Secondary**: `chroma-rag` - Vector embeddings for semantic search and pattern matching
- **Tertiary**: `sqlite` - Structured metrics with ML training labels and effectiveness scoring
- **Quaternary**: `Knowledge/` files - Persistent markdown with consistent frontmatter metadata

**Cross-Referenced Resources with Semantic Linking:**
- `Knowledge/patterns/industry_best_practices_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md` - Researched patterns with ML feature extraction
- `Knowledge/patterns/competitive_advantages_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md` - Unique positioning insights with success classification
- `Knowledge/context/benchmark_data_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md` - Performance baselines with effectiveness scoring
- `Instructions/priority_implementations_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md` - Quick wins with success/failure labels for reinforcement learning
