## ðŸš€ 10X FEATURE SPECIFICATION & INSTRUCTION CREATOR
*Powered by competitive intelligence and proven specification patterns*

**Claude, create COMPREHENSIVE feature specifications using GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE and PROVEN PATTERNS.**

### ðŸ“‹ **REQUIRED PARAMETERS - IDENTIFY FROM CONTEXT**
**BEFORE starting, analyze the project/conversation to identify:**
- **[feature_name]**: Name of the feature to specify (e.g., "user authentication", "payment processing")
- **[feature_type]**: Category of feature (e.g., "authentication", "data processing", "UI component")
- **[tech_stack]**: Primary technology stack (e.g., "React TypeScript", "Python Django", "Node.js Express")
- **[framework]**: Main framework being used (e.g., "React", "Angular", "Vue", "Django", "Rails")
- **[domain]**: Business domain/industry (e.g., "e-commerce", "fintech", "healthcare", "SaaS")
- **[top_competitors]**: Identify 3-5 main competitors in the space

**PARAMETER DETECTION EXAMPLES:**
- If user says "I want to add login functionality" â†’ [feature_name]="user login", [feature_type]="authentication"
- If codebase has package.json with React â†’ [tech_stack]="React", [framework]="React"
- If it's an e-commerce site â†’ [domain]="e-commerce", [top_competitors]="Amazon, Shopify, WooCommerce"

### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: MARKET & TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE GATHERING** (use "think hard")

**1.1 Competitive Feature Analysis**
- **websearch**: "how [top_competitors] implement [feature_type] specification"
- **websearch**: "[feature_name] requirements specification best practices"
- **fetch**: Analyze feature specifications from leading tech companies
- **github**: Research specification patterns from high-starred projects
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review specification templates and patterns with intelligent classification and cross-system access

**1.2 Technical Specification Research**
- **websearch**: "[tech_stack] [feature_type] technical requirements"
- **websearch**: "API specification patterns [framework] best practices"
- **github**: Find proven specification formats and documentation
- **fetch**: Download specification templates from successful projects
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review previous successful specification patterns with intelligent classification and cross-system access

**1.3 User Experience & Requirements Intelligence**
- **websearch**: "[feature_type] user stories acceptance criteria patterns"
- **websearch**: "UX specification requirements accessibility patterns"
- **fetch**: UX specification guidelines from design systems
- **github**: Research user story patterns from agile projects
- **websearch**: "[domain] business requirements specification templates"

### âš¡ **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT SPECIFICATION CREATION** (use "ultrathink")

**2.1 Market-Informed Requirements**
Create comprehensive requirements based on competitive analysis:
- **Business requirements**: Market positioning and competitive advantages
- **Functional requirements**: Feature capabilities exceeding industry standards
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance/security benchmarks
- **User requirements**: Research-backed user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Technical requirements**: Architecture aligned with proven patterns

**2.2 Specification Architecture**
- **Executive summary**: Business value and competitive positioning
- **Detailed feature breakdown**: Component-by-component specifications
- **API specifications**: Following industry-standard documentation formats
- **Data models**: Using proven database design patterns
- **Integration requirements**: Based on successful integration patterns

### ðŸ“Š **ENHANCED OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**

**Comprehensive Specification Documents:**
- `Instructions/features/[feature]_specification.md` - Complete feature specification
- `Instructions/features/[feature]_technical_requirements.md` - Technical specifications
- `Instructions/features/[feature]_user_stories.md` - User requirements and acceptance criteria
- `Instructions/features/[feature]_api_specification.md` - API design and documentation
- `Instructions/features/[feature]_implementation_guide.md` - Step-by-step development

**Knowledge Base Integration:**
- `Knowledge/patterns/[feature_type]_specification_patterns.md` - Extracted best practices
- `Knowledge/intelligence/[feature]_competitive_analysis.md` - Market positioning
- `Knowledge/documentation/[feature]_requirements_research.md` - Research findings

### ðŸ“Š **STRUCTURED DATA OUTPUT WITH ML TRAINING PREPARATION**

**Multi-System Storage Architecture:**
```yaml
# Feature Specification Report
filename: Knowledge/specifications/feature_spec_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md
frontmatter:
  type: feature_specification
  timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
  classification: specification_intelligence
  ml_labels: [spec_completeness, market_validation, technical_accuracy]
  success_metrics: [requirements_coverage, implementation_readiness, user_satisfaction]
  cross_references: [competitive_analysis, technical_patterns, user_research]
```

**Redundant Storage with Intelligent Classification:**
- **Primary**: `smart_memory_unified` - Unified orchestration with automatic content classification
- **Secondary**: `chroma-rag` - Vector embeddings for specification pattern matching and requirement similarity
- **Tertiary**: `sqlite` - Structured metrics with ML training labels and effectiveness scoring
- **Quaternary**: `Knowledge/` files - Persistent markdown with consistent frontmatter metadata

**ML Training Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "feature_specification_session": {
    "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
    "features": {
      "specification_completeness": 0.92,
      "market_research_depth": 0.88,
      "technical_accuracy": 0.90,
      "implementation_readiness": 0.85
    },
    "outcomes": {
      "development_efficiency": 0.87,
      "user_satisfaction_score": 0.89,
      "market_competitiveness": 0.91
    },
    "classification_labels": ["complete_specification", "market_validated", "implementation_ready"],
    "success_probability": 0.89
  }
}
```

**Cross-System Synchronization:**
- **chroma-rag**: Create semantic embeddings for specification patterns and requirement relationships
- **smart_memory_unified**: Store specification methodologies with automatic classification routing
- **sqlite**: Track specification metrics and success correlations for ML model training
- **Knowledge/patterns/**: Archive successful specification patterns with effectiveness scoring
