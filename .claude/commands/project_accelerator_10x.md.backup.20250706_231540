```yaml
# Project Acceleration Report
filename: Knowledge/acceleration/project_acceleration_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md
frontmatter:
  type: project_acceleration
  timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
  classification: development_intelligence
  ml_labels: [velocity_improvement, competitive_analysis, resource_optimization]
  success_metrics: [development_speed_multiplier, quality_score, market_positioning]
