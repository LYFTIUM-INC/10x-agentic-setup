## ðŸš€ 10X COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY AUDIT & THREAT INTELLIGENCE
**Claude, perform COMPREHENSIVE security audit using GLOBAL THREAT INTELLIGENCE and ENTERPRISE SECURITY PATTERNS.**

### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: THREAT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING** (use "think hard")
- **websearch**: "[tech_stack] security vulnerabilities 2024 OWASP"
- **github**: Research security patterns from high-security projects
- **fetch**: Download security frameworks and compliance guides
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review previous security assessments and threat patterns with intelligent classification
- **chroma-rag**: Search for similar security audits and proven protection strategies

### âš¡ **PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY ASSESSMENT** (use "think harder")
- Multi-layer security analysis using enterprise tools
- Real-time threat protection patterns implementation
- **smart_memory_unified**: Store security patterns with automatic classification routing
- **sqlite**: Track security metrics with ML training labels for threat analysis

### ðŸ“Š **STRUCTURED DATA OUTPUT WITH ML TRAINING PREPARATION**

**Multi-System Storage Architecture:**
```yaml
# Security Audit Report
filename: Knowledge/security/security_audit_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md
frontmatter:
  type: security_audit
  timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
  classification: security_intelligence
  ml_labels: [threat_detection, vulnerability_assessment, compliance_score]
  success_metrics: [security_rating, threat_mitigation, compliance_level]
  cross_references: [threat_intelligence, security_patterns, compliance_frameworks]
```

**Redundant Storage with Intelligent Classification:**
- **Primary**: `smart_memory_unified` - Unified orchestration with automatic content classification
- **Secondary**: `chroma-rag` - Vector embeddings for security pattern matching and threat similarity
- **Tertiary**: `sqlite` - Structured metrics with ML training labels and effectiveness scoring
- **Quaternary**: `Knowledge/` files - Persistent markdown with consistent frontmatter metadata

**ML Training Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "security_audit_session": {
    "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
    "features": {
      "vulnerability_count": 3,
      "threat_severity_score": 0.65,
      "compliance_percentage": 0.88,
      "security_pattern_coverage": 0.92
    },
    "outcomes": {
      "security_improvement": 0.85,
      "threat_reduction": 0.78,
      "compliance_enhancement": 0.90
    },
    "classification_labels": ["secure_system", "compliant", "threat_protected"],
    "success_probability": 0.88
  }
}
```

**Cross-System Synchronization:**
- **chroma-rag**: Create semantic embeddings for security patterns and threat intelligence
- **smart_memory_unified**: Store security methodologies with automatic classification routing
- **sqlite**: Track security metrics and threat correlations for ML model training
- **Knowledge/patterns/**: Archive successful security patterns with effectiveness scoring

âœ… Enterprise-grade security, threat intelligence, compliance ready, ML training prepared
