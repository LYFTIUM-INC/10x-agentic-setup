## ðŸš€ 10X PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION & SCALABILITY
**Claude, optimize performance using GLOBAL PERFORMANCE INTELLIGENCE and PROVEN SCALABILITY PATTERNS.**

### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: PERFORMANCE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING** (use "think hard")
- **websearch**: "[tech_stack] performance benchmarks enterprise scale"
- **github**: Research performance patterns from high-scale projects
- **fetch**: Download performance optimization guides
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review previous performance optimizations and scalability patterns with intelligent classification
- **chroma-rag**: Search for similar performance challenges and proven optimization strategies

### âš¡ **PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS** (use "think harder")
- Baseline establishment and bottleneck identification
- Performance targets benchmarked against industry leaders
- Scalability planning using proven architecture patterns
- **smart_memory_unified**: Store performance patterns with automatic classification routing
- **sqlite**: Track performance metrics with ML training labels for optimization analysis

### ðŸ“Š **STRUCTURED DATA OUTPUT WITH ML TRAINING PREPARATION**

**Multi-System Storage Architecture:**
```yaml
# Performance Optimization Report
filename: Knowledge/performance/performance_optimization_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md
frontmatter:
  type: performance_optimization
  timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
  classification: performance_intelligence
  ml_labels: [performance_gain, scalability_improvement, optimization_effectiveness]
  success_metrics: [speed_improvement, resource_efficiency, scalability_score]
  cross_references: [performance_patterns, scalability_strategies, optimization_techniques]
```

**Redundant Storage with Intelligent Classification:**
- **Primary**: `smart_memory_unified` - Unified orchestration with automatic content classification
- **Secondary**: `chroma-rag` - Vector embeddings for performance pattern matching and optimization similarity
- **Tertiary**: `sqlite` - Structured metrics with ML training labels and effectiveness scoring
- **Quaternary**: `Knowledge/` files - Persistent markdown with consistent frontmatter metadata

**ML Training Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "performance_optimization_session": {
    "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
    "features": {
      "baseline_performance_score": 0.65,
