## ðŸš€ 10X INTELLIGENT FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
**Claude, implement features using INDUSTRY-LEADING practices with COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE.**
### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: MARKET-INFORMED FEATURE RESEARCH** (use "think hard")
- **websearch**: "how [top_3_competitors] implement [feature_type]"
- **github**: Search highest-starred projects with similar features
- **fetch**: Analyze competitor implementations
- **memory**: Review relevant protocols and patterns
### âš¡ **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN PLANNING**
- Market positioning vs competitors
- Performance targets based on industry benchmarks
- Security patterns from latest threat intelligence
### ðŸŽ¯ **PHASE 3: RESEARCH-BACKED IMPLEMENTATION**
- Test-first with industry patterns
- Implementation with proven code patterns
- Performance optimization using industry techniques
âœ… Market-informed design, research-backed architecture, performance optimized
