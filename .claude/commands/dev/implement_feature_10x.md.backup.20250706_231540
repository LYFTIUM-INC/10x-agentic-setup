## ðŸš€ 10X INTELLIGENT FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
**Claude, implement features using INDUSTRY-LEADING practices with COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE.**
### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: MARKET-INFORMED FEATURE RESEARCH** (use "think hard")
- **websearch**: "how [top_3_competitors] implement [feature_type]"
- **github**: Search highest-starred projects with similar features
- **fetch**: Analyze competitor implementations
- **context7**: Get latest framework documentation (add "use context7" to all framework-specific prompts)
- **smart_memory_unified**: Review relevant protocols and patterns with intelligent classification and cross-system access
### âš¡ **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN PLANNING**
- Market positioning vs competitors
- Performance targets based on industry benchmarks
- Security patterns from latest threat intelligence
### ðŸŽ¯ **PHASE 3: RESEARCH-BACKED IMPLEMENTATION**
- Test-first with industry patterns (use context7 for current testing frameworks)
- Implementation with proven code patterns (context7 ensures current API usage)
- Performance optimization using industry techniques (context7 provides latest optimization patterns)
### ðŸ“Š **STRUCTURED DATA OUTPUT WITH ML TRAINING PREPARATION**

**Multi-System Storage Architecture:**
```yaml
# Feature Implementation Report
filename: Knowledge/development/feature_implementation_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md
frontmatter:
  type: feature_implementation
  timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
  classification: development_intelligence
  ml_labels: [implementation_success, competitive_analysis, performance_optimization]
  success_metrics: [implementation_speed, quality_score, market_alignment]
  cross_references: [market_research, technical_patterns, competitive_intelligence]
```

**Redundant Storage with Intelligent Classification:**
- **Primary**: `smart_memory_unified` - Unified orchestration with automatic content classification
- **Secondary**: `chroma-rag` - Vector embeddings for implementation pattern matching
- **Tertiary**: `sqlite` - Structured metrics with ML training labels and effectiveness scoring
- **Quaternary**: `Knowledge/` files - Persistent markdown with consistent frontmatter metadata

**ML Training Data Structure:**
```json

  "implementation_session": {
    "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
    "features": {
      "market_research_quality": 0.88,
      "competitive_analysis_depth": 0.92,

    },
    "classification_labels": ["successful_implementation", "market_validated", "performance_optimized"],
    "success_probability": 0.89
  }
}
```

**Cross-System Synchronization:**
- **chroma-rag**: Create semantic embeddings for implementation patterns and competitive intelligence
- **smart_memory_unified**: Store implementation methodologies with automatic classification routing
- **sqlite**: Track implementation metrics and success correlations for ML model training
- **Knowledge/patterns/**: Archive successful implementation patterns with effectiveness scoring

âœ… Market-informed design, research-backed architecture, current API usage, performance optimized, ML training ready
