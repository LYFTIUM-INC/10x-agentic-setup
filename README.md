# 🚀 10X Agentic Coding Environment Setup

**Ultimate Agentic Development Environment with Central Coordination Agent (CCA) Architecture**

Transform your development workflow with the most advanced 2025 agentic engineering paradigms, featuring autonomous project orchestration and competitive intelligence-driven development.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### New Project Setup
```bash
# Create new 10X agentic project
./10x-agentic-coding.sh my-awesome-project

# With specific configuration
./10x-agentic-coding.sh -t typescript -d ~/projects web-app
```

### Enhance Existing Project
```bash
# Add 10X agentic capabilities to current project
./10x-agentic-local.sh

## 🧠 Master Command Orchestrator

The revolutionary **analyze_and_execute** command implements a Central Coordination Agent (CCA) that:

- **Autonomously analyzes** your entire project
- **Intelligently prioritizes** optimal command sequences  
- **Automatically executes** based on project needs
- **Continuously learns** and improves performance

```bash
# Single command for complete project orchestration
/analyze_and_execute
```
